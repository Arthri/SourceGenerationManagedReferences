This project primarily serves to demonstrate automatic packing of dependencies into the analyzer folder for a standalone source generator (i.e. not attached to a library).

`SourceGenerationManagedReferences` is the source generator project, the primary subject of this repository. Any dependencies that aren't available to analyzers, such as `System.Text.Json`, are declared in another project named `SourceGenerationManagedReferences.Dependencies`. Dependencies are declared this way to leverage much of the existing infrastructure handling the dependency graph and to isolate dependencies that are available to source generators, such as `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis`, from those that aren't. Admittedly, this approach leads to a longer and less self-explanatory configuration, therefore, parts of this project might be better packaged as a build tool.

Two sample projects are provided referencing the source generator project in the `samples` folder. Please run the `packnpushlocal.sh` bash script before trying to build them. The bash script essentially builds and packs the `SourceGenerationManagedReferences` project and pushes the resulting package into the top-level `packages` folder, which is declared a NuGet source through the project-local `nuget.config`.
